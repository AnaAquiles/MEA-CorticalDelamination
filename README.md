# Multielectrode array evaluation with cortical delamination 

The following repository contains all the code generated and used to describe the the degree of cortical delamination through electrical pattern analysis. 
In general way you will found the functions to load and downsampling data from MSC software, using hierarchical data files hdf5. 

The work flow of the same is described below 🫰
## Description of the analysis
